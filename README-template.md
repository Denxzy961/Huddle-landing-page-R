Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks
🌐 Overview
This is a responsive landing page built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The page showcases the Huddle platform with alternating feature sections, a clear call to action, and a clean, modern layout. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed via Vercel.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my front-end development skills, particularly in layout design, responsive styling, and code organization.
